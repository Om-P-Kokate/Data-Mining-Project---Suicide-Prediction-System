# Data-Mining-Project - Suicide Prediction System

This **Suicide Prediction System** leverages data science to analyze various environmental and socioeconomic factors, including GDP, weather conditions, happiness index, suicide rates, and temperature of different countries. By examining these factors, the system aims to identify trends and patterns in suicide rates and develop predictive models to assess suicide risks. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to provide insights that can help organizations and mental health professionals take proactive measures to prevent suicides and improve public health outcomes.

## Section 2 - Data Collection, Preparation, Cleaning & Visualizations

### Data Collection
This project uses data from multiple sources, including:
- **GDP**: Economic data of various countries.
- **Weather**: Climate data such as temperature and weather conditions.
- **Happiness Index**: Global happiness scores.
- **Suicide Rates**: Historical data on suicide rates.
- **Population**: Population statistics for each country.

### Data Preparation
- Data was collected using web scraping and APIs to ensure authenticity and reliability.
- The collected data was cleaned by:
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed or removed missing data points as appropriate.
  - **Removing Outliers**: Identified and removed anomalies to ensure data integrity.
  - **Ensuring Consistency**: Standardized formats across different datasets.
- Multiple CSV files were merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

### Data Visualizations
- Various data visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs, are used to represent relationships between factors and suicide rates.
- Each visualization provides insights into trends and correlations that influence suicide rates, helping to visualize complex data in an understandable manner.

### Insights from Visualizations
- **Bar Charts**: Show the suicide rate across the countries.
- **Scatter Plots**: Illustrate correlations between population and suicide rates.
- **Heatmap**: Display the correlation between these factors.
