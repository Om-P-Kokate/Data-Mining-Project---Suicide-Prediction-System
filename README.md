# Data-Mining-Project---Suicide-Prediction-System
This Suicide Prediction System leverages data science to analyze various environmental and socioeconomic factors, including GDP, weather conditions, happiness index, suicide rates, and temperature of different countries. By examining these factors, the system aims to identify trends and patterns in suicide rates and develop predictive models to assess suicide risks. The project uses machine learning techniques to provide insights that can help organizations and mental health professionals take proactive measures to prevent suicides and improve public health outcomes.

## Section 2 -  Data Collection, Preparation, Cleaning & Visualizations

This project uses data from multiple sources, including:
- **GDP**: Economic data of various countries.
- **Weather**: Climate data such as temperature and weather conditions.
- **Happiness Index**: Global happiness scores.
- **Suicide Rates**: Historical data on suicide rates.

### Data Preparation
- Collected data was cleaned by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency across datasets.
- Multiple CSV files were merged for comprehensive analysis.

### Visualizations
- Various data visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs, are used to represent relationships between factors and suicide rates.
- Visualizations help identify trends and insights into the factors influencing suicide rates.
